# AuraCode

**AuraCode** is an AI-powered coding education platform designed to address a key challenge faced by CodeCamp Jr.: keeping younger students engaged while supporting their diverse learning styles. Traditional after-school coding programs often struggle to maintain attention and adapt to different learners, which can limit student progress and enthusiasm.

## üöÄ What It Does

- Presents each lesson inside a **live code editor**, focusing learners on writing real code  
- Uses **microlearning** to break lessons into short, focused steps ideal for younger attention spans  
- Includes **multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** and practice tasks to reinforce understanding  
- Offers optional **gamification** such as XP, streaks, and unlockables to motivate engagement  
- Allows users to set goals and creates personalized lesson plans tailored to experience and interests  

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

AuraCode engages young learners by immersing them in an interactive, hands-on coding environment from the start. Lessons are carefully segmented into bite-sized steps that introduce concepts gradually, matching students‚Äô attention spans and skill levels. Regular MCQs and coding challenges encourage active learning and help solidify key ideas.

Gamified elements like XP and streaks provide positive reinforcement and motivation, while remaining optional to accommodate learners who prefer a straightforward approach. The platform‚Äôs adaptive lesson planning ensures content aligns with each student‚Äôs goals and learning pace.

## üéØ How AuraCode Solves the Problem

CodeCamp Jr. faces the ongoing challenge of keeping younger students motivated and accommodating different learning styles. AuraCode solves this by:

- **Focusing on hands-on coding:** learners actively write and debug real code, which builds practical skills  
- **Microlearning format:** short, manageable lessons keep students focused without overwhelming them  
- **Interactive reinforcement:** MCQs and practice tasks ensure understanding through active engagement  
- **Flexible motivation:** optional gamification appeals to competitive learners while supporting traditional preferences  
- **Personalized plans:** tailoring content and pacing to individual goals helps maintain interest and progress  

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

- **Swift** powers the iOS frontend, delivering a smooth and intuitive experience for young learners  
- **Python + FastAPI** runs the backend, handling lesson logic, user management, and content delivery  
- **Firebase** manages authentication, real-time data syncing, and storage  
- **Google Generative AI Kit (Gemini)** dynamically generates lesson content and explanations  
- Tight integration between **Swift**, **Firebase**, and **Python APIs** ensures seamless operation  

## üîÆ Future Ideas

- **Ghost code blocks:** starter code that students can fix or extend  
- **Text-to-speech (TTS):** support for auditory learners  
- **Manim animations and diagrams:** visual aids for complex concepts  
- **AI tutor personality modes:** customizable guidance styles like strict or friendly  
- **Enhanced learning style adaptation:** switching between audio, visual, and interactive content  
- **Web-based platform:** to broaden access beyond iOS  
- **Expanded interactive features:** including reflections, more MCQs, and sandbox coding environments
